# massivebird's website

Welcome to my static site powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)! I plan on using this site as a blog and portfolio.

## Development

Install Zola and run `zola serve`.

If you're on NixOS, run `nix develop` to invoke this repository's `flake.nix`. That will create a shell with Zola installed.
