Git is a VCS (Version Control Software) that records a history of changes made to your digital projects. These changes can be freely reverted, altered, and reviewed. This system facilitates experimentation and collaboration — if you break something, just revert to the latest working version of your project!

Combined with services like GitHub, you can also create cloud-based copies of your projects that you can freely update, download, and share. GitHub safely hosts your projects in case you drop your hard drive in the toilet.

Any time Git detects new changes to your project, you can create a new _commit_ containing some or all of said changes. Commits can be bundled with a short title for your convenience. A project's _commit history_ or _log_ can be viewed at any time.

Along with navigating/rewinding through commit histories, those are Git's flagship features in a nutshell — and they can be harnessed with only a few commands! This is all you need to start saving intermediate project progress and feeling confident in taking risks. These Git fundamentals will also introduce you to creating backups of projects on GitHub so that you'll always have them in the cloud.

If you go beyond the basics, you'll learn branching histories, reordering/combining commits, collaboration strategies, and more.

## Getting started

Git can be used in the terminal or through a graphical interface. I recommend learning with the terminal app! The GUI is just so ugly and clunky.

Don't worry, the command line is totally awesome! Git doesn't require anything more than the basics, which you can learn through [Ubuntu's Bash shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).
