# What is arcsearch?

Arcsearch is a command line utility for searching digital video game archives! Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ðŸ¦€

A _digital video game archive_ â€” or _archive_, for short â€” is a directory that contains [retro] games in various ROM and ISO formats.

> When I refer to "arcsearch," I am referring to the _Rust_ project. You can read about the four different arcsearch projects in the _[History](#epilogue-history)_ section.

## Motivation

My archive has more than 1,000 games across thirteen game systems. I wanted a fast and easy way to query my archive, especially to avoid redownloading games I already have in my collection. Windows File Explorer is the worst thing ever, so I decided to write a program myself.

## Epilogue â€” History

Arcsearch has been reborn many times. Let's walk through the saga!

### Act I: Bash

Arcsearch's first version was written in Bash! I wrote this when I was first learning the Linux command line; it was a great opportunity to practice my Bash skills. You can find the latest version of `arcsearch.sh` [here](https://github.com/massivebird/dotfiles/blob/98cd02161010b6b4fd98384dec0b19657f852df9/scripts/arcsearch.sh).

I definitely wouldn't recommend writing something this complex in Bash. Even though it was a pain and runtimes are long, `arcsearch.sh` is totally functional!

> Did you know Bash supports associative arrays? I wish I didn't.

### Act II: C++

To make Arcsearch faster, I rewrote it in C++. I concocted something functional thanks to some prior C++ experience and frantic Googling. The runtimes were incredible compared to Bash, and it became my preferred version for that reason â€” but I felt empty inside.

I felt like I learned nothing from writing `arcsearch.cpp`. I was (and am) apathetic towards and uninterested in C++ as a language; I didn't feel motivated to improve the project further.

I wanted to write Arcsearch in a fun, performant language that I could comfortably maintain and improve. _Rust's siren call beckoned me._

> `arcsearch.cpp` has been lost to time, but maybe it's for the best.

### Act III: Rust

After my third and final attempt at learning Rust, it stuck. Arcsearch was my first major Rust project, and I am incredibly proud of it. I achieved the performance of C++ _and_ loved maintaining it. Arcsearch's Rust implementation remains the most feature-rich and performant version to date.

### Honorable mention: Python

I partially rewrote Arcsearch in Python just to say that I did. I'm not Python's biggest fan, but I'll admit that `arcsearch-py` was really easy to write. The feature set is incomplete, but the program is totally functional. It even supports the same YAML configuration file format as the Rust version!
