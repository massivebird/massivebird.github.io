My name is Garrett. Welcome to my website!

I like writing Rust programs, configuring my NixOS machine, playing kendama, drinking water, listening to Machine Girl, and playing Dota 2.

I usually write blogs about computer stuff.

## About this website

This website is totally open source! You can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/massivebird/massivebird.github.io).

This site is powered by the static site generator, [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). Zola builds websites from a simple collection of Markdown files and HTML templates.

I am using a wonderful Zola theme called [Hook](https://github.com/InputUsername/zola-hook).
