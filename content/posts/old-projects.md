Revisiting and improving old programming projects is the perfect opportunity to hone critical software engineering skills. You might even discover optimizations that make a project better than ever!

# The advantages

You might feel intimidated by your code since you've forgotten how it all works. _"What does this variable do?" "Why is it built like this?" "What the hell was I thinking?"_ Don't worry! It's actually better that you forgot. Let me explain.

## Building your code literacy

This is a fantastic opportunity to hone your _code literacy_, especially if you've forgotten how your old codebase works! Code literacy is the ability to gain an intuitive notion about how some code works just by sight-reading it. This is a widely applicable skill that makes you a more consistent and reliable developer, while improving your capacity to review others' code.

> If you ask me, code literacy is also becoming increasingly desirable. Developers are becoming overly reliant on AI coding assistants, opting to defer literacy challenges at the slightest inconvenience.

You've hopefully forgotten how your codebase works; this is the mathematically perfect literacy-building context, since you have minimal pre-conceived notions going in!

Even if you relearn the codebase but find few opportunities to improve it, you have still practiced your literacy! Practice is practice is practice.

## Reinforcing habits and best practices

The best way to cement your wisdom is through practice. By revisiting old projects, you'll identify opportunities to improve performance, code readability, or both.

The fact that you are newly capable of recognizing these situations is proof that you have improved as a developer; furthermore, making these changes to a real codebase reinforces your knowledge into long-term habits.

## It's badass

It just feels great to revive a dead-end project. Maybe you manage to turn a shitty project into one worth being proud of and sharing with others. Or maybe you discover runtime optimizations applicable to other projects. There are so many possibilities, and they'll all make you feel super cool.

To start, I recommend revisiting any old project you remember being challenging, too slow, or maybe unfinished. Relearn the codebase, hone your literacy, and maybe you'll even completely transform a project into something exceptional.

# Testimonials: reviving my own projects

For some motivation, here are some examples of my own projects that I revisited and revitalized :3

## Arcsearch: introducing async

[massivebird/arcsearch](https://github.com/massivebird/Arcsearch) is a tool I use to search through my retro game library. I have over one thousand ROMs and ISOs across plenty of platforms, and Arcsearch makes it so easy to search though that collection.

I used it for the first time in a while, and I was underwhelmed by its performance. I looked through the source code and was shocked â€” I never implemented asynchronous operations! When I originally wrote Arcsearch, I had no clue how to implement async ops with a deterministic output. Revisiting the code months later, I had a promising idea within minutes.

By this point, I had read a decent chunk of [_Asynchronous Programming in Rust_](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/), and I had made plenty of asynchronous programs using the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime.

Within an hour, I improved Arcsearch's runtime performance by approximately 60% (from 660ms to 220ms). It's almost _too_ fast now.

## Funky Board: a total rewrite

[massivebird/funky_board](https://github.com/massivebird/funky_board) is a [zero-player game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game) that I originally wrote in Java for a final project in college. I ported it over to Rust as one of my first major Rust projects.

> My first attempt at writing a Rust port of Funky Board ended catastrophically. I was in the middle of reading [The Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html), and needless to say, I was not prepared. I got overwhelmed, and in my frustration, I gave up on learning Rust for a couple months.

You can check out the repo for a detailed look into the rules. Basically, autonomous pieces move around a board and capture other pieces by landing on them, similar to chess.

I revisited my Rust port with disgust. My code relied heavily on `.clone()` (an undesirable, computationally expensive crutch), and my data structures were morbidly designed. Eliminating the former is an exercise in navigating Rust's complex borrow checker rules, and I wanted to prove that I was finally capable of doing it. Alongside fixing the latter, I chose to start from scratch.

[_Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists_](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) prepared me for this moment. I was ready to flex my interior mutability muscles, design decent data structures with sensible APIs, and most importantly, rationalize about Rust's borrow checker. In the end, I proved myself capable, and a new Funky Board was born.

This evolved Funky Board is a dramatic improvement in readability _and_ functionality. On top of that, I'm extremely proud of untangling the immutable reference spaghetti and eliminating all those `.clone()` calls. I even threw in a [strategy design pattern](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/strategy.html) using Rust's trait objects, which makes adding new movement types trivial.
